At the beginning of the automobile era, Michelin, a tire company, created a travel guide, including a restaurant guide.
Through the years, Michelin stars have become very prestigious due to their high standards and very strict anonymous testers. Michelin Stars are incredibly 
coveted. Gaining just one can change a chef's life; losing one, however, can change it as well.
